# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

In this analysis there are two dashboards, one with month-over-month data for November and December 2019. There were 20M rides
in November compared to 13M in December. A hypothesis for this is the decline in weather or increased vacation time during the
holidays and decreased rides getting to work. The age bracket with the greatest number of citi bike usage (count of rides) is 
the age group between 20-39. This could be for multiple reasons; youth, a average age of people communuting into NYC via public
transit, or the average age of people working in NYC. Further data would be required to solidify these pre-conceived notions. For
every day in November and December more males rode Citi bikes compared to females or unknown gender.

The second dashboard is data useful for the bike tech team. This easiest actionable item here is identifying the top 10 bikes with
the greatest miles rode. This will help the technicians identify which bikes to closely monitor or take to the shop for a tune-up
or check-up. The caveat with this is once a bike is tuned-up and put back on the market there is not reset on the miles rode on the
bike unless there's a new bike ID given after refurbishment. This system would work perfectly if the bike was just recycled. This 
dashboard also has the most start and end stations to identify where the end of day Citi bike trucks need to go to redistribute for
the morning commute. There is also information and the most popular start and end stations to make sure they are distributed properly.
